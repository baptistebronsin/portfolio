# Open Source Projects

The open source ecosystem is a vibrant and dynamic space that fosters collaboration, innovation, and community engagement. Contributing to open source projects allows developers to give back to the community, improve their skills, and work on projects that they are passionate about. In this section, I will share some of the open source projects that I'm involved in, along with my contributions and experiences.

## Why Contribute to Open Source ?

Contributing to open source projects has several benefits:

- **Skill development**: It provides an opportunity to learn new technologies, improve coding skills, and gain experience working on real-world projects.
- **Community engagement**: It allows you to connect with other developers, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects that have a positive impact on the community.
- **Career growth**: Contributing to open source can enhance your resume, showcase your skills to potential employers, and open up new career opportunities.
- **Personal satisfaction**: It can be personally rewarding to see your contributions being used by others and to be part of a project that you care about.

## My Contributions

I have taken an interest in some open source projects and tried to contribute to them in various ways.

### FerrisKey

FerrisKey ([github](https://github.com/ferriskey)) is an open source project that provides a secure and user-friendly IAM (Identity and Access Management) solution. It wants to replace the Keycloak project and offers more security features and better performance. I have contributed to FerrisKey by fixing bugs and improving documentation.

Here are my contributions:

- [[issue #655] Document the API endpoints](https://github.com/ferriskey/ferriskey/pull/728)
- [[issue #755] [Add default client scopes when creating a realm](https://github.com/ferriskey/ferriskey/pull/768)

### Docker mail server

Docker mail server ([github](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver)) is an open source project that provides a simple and efficient way to set up a mail server using Docker. This community has a main problem: they don't provide an API to manage the mail server, which makes it difficult to automate tasks and integrate with other systems.

So I created a project called [docker-mailserver-api](https://github.com/baptistebronsin/docker-mailserver-api) that provides a RESTful API in Rust to manage the Docker mail server. This project allows users to easily manage their mail server, automate tasks, and integrate with other systems. However, this project is still in its early stages and I'm facing some challenges to interact with the Docker mail server process. I'm actively working on it and I hope to make it available for the community soon.

## How to Get Involved

If you're interested in contributing to open source projects, here are some tips to get started:

1. **Find a project**: Look for projects that align with your interests and skills. You can explore platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to find open source projects.
2. **Start small**: Begin by fixing small bugs, improving documentation, or adding tests. This will help you get familiar with the project and build confidence before tackling larger issues.
3. **Communicate**: Join the project's community forums, mailing lists, or chat channels to ask questions, share your ideas, and collaborate with other contributors.
4. **Be patient**: Open source projects are often maintained by volunteers, so it may take time for your contributions to be reviewed and merged. Be patient and respectful of the maintainers' time and efforts.
5. **Keep learning**: Contributing to open source is a continuous learning process. Stay curious, keep improving your skills, and enjoy the journey of being part of the open source community.

## Conclusion

Contributing to open source projects is a rewarding experience that allows you to grow as a developer, connect with like-minded individuals, and make a positive impact on the community. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved and contribute to projects that you care about. I encourage everyone to explore the world of open source and find projects that inspire you to contribute and collaborate.
