# Open source projects

The open source ecosystem is a vibrant and dynamic space that fosters collaboration, innovation, and community engagement. Contributing to open source projects allows developers to give back to the community, improve their skills and work on projects that they are passionate about. In this section, I will share some of the open source projects that I'm involved in, along with my contributions and experiences.

## My Contributions

I have taken an interest in some open source projects and tried to contribute to them in various ways.

### FerrisKey

FerrisKey ([github](https://github.com/ferriskey)) is an open source project that provides a secure and user-friendly IAM (Identity and Access Management) solution. It wants to replace the Keycloak project and offers more security features and better performance. I have contributed to FerrisKey by fixing bugs and improving documentation.

Here are my contributions:

- [[issue #655] Document the API endpoints](https://github.com/ferriskey/ferriskey/pull/728)
- [[issue #755] Add default client scopes when creating a realm](https://github.com/ferriskey/ferriskey/pull/768)

### Docker mail server

Docker mail server ([github](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver)) is an open source project that provides a simple and efficient way to set up a mail server using Docker. This community has a main problem: they don't provide an API to manage the mail server, which makes it difficult to automate tasks and integrate with other systems.

So I created a project called [docker-mailserver-api](https://github.com/baptistebronsin/docker-mailserver-api) that provides a RESTful API in Rust to manage the Docker mail server. This project allows users to easily manage their mail server, automate tasks, and integrate with other systems. However, this project is still in its early stages and I'm facing some challenges to interact with the Docker mail server process. I'm actively working on it and I hope to make it available for the community soon.
