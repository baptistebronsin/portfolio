This project combines the power of Astro with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide a smooth development experience.\n\n## Why Explainer?\n\nDocumentation is often overlooked, but it's essential for the adoption and effective use of your project.\nExplainer fills an important gap in the technical documentation ecosystem. While Vue has robust solutions like Vitepress, the React ecosystem suffers from a lack of alternatives that don't depend on Next.js. Most documentation frameworks for React are closely tied to Next.js, which can be limiting for many projects.\n\nThis is where Astro, and by extension Explainer, particularly shines. Astro offers remarkable flexibility by allowing you to integrate any technological component related to your business. You can easily incorporate React, Vue, Svelte components, or even standard web elements according to your specific needs.\n\nThis agnostic approach allows you to create documentation that perfectly aligns with your existing technology stack, without forcing you to adopt a particular ecosystem. Whether you work with React, Vue, or other frameworks, Explainer adapts to your needs rather than the other way around.","src/content/articles/welcome.mdx","3eedee35818e4cdc",true,"how-i-configured-my-own-home-server",{"id":24,"data":26,"body":20,"filePath":31,"digest":32,"deferredRender":23},{"title":27,"description":28,"permalink":24,"thumbnail":16,"authors":29,"publishedAt":30},"How I configured my own home server ?","A personnal home server is a great way to learn about server administration, networking and security.
